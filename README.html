        <h1>WELCOME TO TEAMS</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Teams is a command line based app that allows users to join teams of their peers remotely, set their status,
            see the stati of their peers, and switch teams.</p>
        
        <p>Some Assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clients know the <b>IP address and port</b> of the server</li>
            <li>Clients know the ID of the team they would like to join</li>
            <li>Clients coordinate amongst themselves to determine which teams they will join</li>
            <li>Clients are only allowed in 1 team at a time</li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        
        <h3>Server Admin</h3>
        <p>To initialize the server, use a command prompt to navigate to the <code>src</code> folder of the app. Once there, use
            the following command to start the server: <code>java TeamServer</code>. The server admin will be prompted to
            provide
            the <b>port number</b> on which the server will listen for incoming messages. After that, the server is initialized
            and will operate autonomously!</p>
        
        <h3>Clients</h3>
        <p>To get started, use a command prompt to navigate to the <code>src</code> folder of the app. Once there, use the
            following
            command to start the app client: <code>java TeamClient</code>. Clients will be prompted to provide the <b>IP
                address</b> of the
            server, then the server <b>port number</b>. After that, clients will be able to select from a set of commands:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>CONN (client name) (team ID) (initial status)</code></li>
            <li><code>UPDATE (client ID) (new status)</code></li>
            <li><code>GET (client ID)</code></li>
            <li><code>SWITCH (client ID) (new team ID)</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p><code>CONN</code> takes 3 parameters: the client's name in plain text, the ID of the team the client wishes to
            join, and the client's initial status at the time of connection to the server. Upon using this command, the
            client will receive an acknowledgement from the server that contains their unique ID. Clients must remember
            this ID as they will need it when using the other commands.</p>
        
        <p><code>UPDATE</code> takes 2 parameters: the client's ID (provided after running the <code>CONN</code> command), and
            the client's new
            status. This command will cause the server to update it's backend to reflect the client's updated status.
            Others in the same team will be able to see this new status when they run the <code>GET</code> command.</p>
        
        <p><code>GET</code> takes 1 parameter: the client's ID (provided after running the <code>CONN</code> command). This
            command will request
            from the server the status vector of the client's team, printing a neatly formatted readout with their
            teammates' names and stati.</p>
        
        <p><code>SWITCH</code> takes 2 parameters: the client's ID (provided after running the <code>CONN</code> command), and
            the ID of the team
            the client would like to join. Running this command changes the client's team from their current team to the
            team that matches the ID they provide. They are removed from their previous team.</p>
